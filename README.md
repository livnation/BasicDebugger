# BasicDebugger

A basic debugger for logging exploits in the VR game "Gorilla Tag".

# How to Use

1. Put the .dll in your BepInEx's plugin folder.

2. Create a .txt file in your BepInEx's plugin folder called Exclusions to not debug certain event codes. (Recommended: 201, 206, 200) (Must be seperated by newlines)

3. Launch the game, and check your BepInEx console (if enabled) when in a room.
